# Install UWP apps with App Installer

## Purpose
This section contains or links to articles about App Installer and how to use the features of App Installer. 

App Installer allows for UWP apps to be installed by double clicking the app package. This means that users don't need to use PowerShell or other developer tools to deploy UWP apps. The App Installer can also install an app from the web, optional packages, and related sets. To learn how to use the App Installer to install your app, see the topics in the table.
