# Use map services

To use map services in apps targeting Windows 10 or Windows 8.x, visit the [Bing Maps Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614880). For info about how to request a maps authentication key from the Bing Maps Developer Center and add it to your app, see [Request a maps authentication key](../maps-and-location/authentication-key.md) for more info. 

To use map services in apps for Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier, you need to request a map service application ID and a token to include in your app's code in the Dev Center dashboard.

Any time after you've [reserved your app's name](create-your-app-by-reserving-a-name.md), you can navigate to that app in your dashboard, expand **Services** section in the left navigation menu and select **Maps**. When you click **Get token**, we'll generate a Map service Application ID (**ApplicationID**) and Map service Authentication Token (**AuthenticationToken**) for your app. These values will be saved on this page, so you can return at any time to view them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be sure to add the **ApplicationID** and **AuthenticationToken** to your code before you package and submit your app. For more info, see [How to add a Map control to a page (Windows Phone 8.1)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614882).
